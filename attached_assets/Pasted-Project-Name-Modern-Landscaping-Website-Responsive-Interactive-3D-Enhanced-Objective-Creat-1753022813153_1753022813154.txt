Modern Landscaping Website – Responsive, Interactive, 3D-Enhanced

Objective:
Create a visually engaging, fully responsive, and performance-optimized website for a fictional or real landscaping company. The site should showcase services, projects, testimonials, and contact information using 3D animated elements, scroll-triggered transitions, and a clean modern layout. All content and imagery should be relevant to landscaping, gardening, and outdoor space transformation.
